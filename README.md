# Palindrome GUI

This is a very basic GUI created with Java Swing in NetBeans. Nothing fancy, but I've always wanted to try making a GUI. 

- I learned that it all starts with a jFrame
   - Which holds a jPanel, 
   - Which holds jButtons and 
   - jTextFields and 
   - **J J J J J!!!!**

Enjoy playing with my palindrome GUI! #baby'sfirstGUI :baby:

> To run the project from the command line, go to the dist folder and type the following:
> java -jar "PalindromeCheck.jar"
